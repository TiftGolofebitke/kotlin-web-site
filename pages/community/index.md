# How to spread the knowledge across the community

This site helps Kotlin users spread the word about Kotlin in the most effective and captivating way. We will help you to develop user groups and organize events.

## Kotlin real-life Activities

1. **Local Kotlin User Groups** is a place to share experience between Kotlin programmers. 
   Likewise, bring information about the technology to everyone who is interested. 
   Regular activities is the main idea of user groups. 
   The main goal is to provide support and opportunities for experience sharing and increasing engineering excellence. 
2. **Kotlin Nights** are one-off events that usually include 3-4 talks on Kotlin. 
   The talks should be dedicated to technology, either to Kotlin or to some other compatible approaches 
   and not be focused on marketing, sales or commercials.
