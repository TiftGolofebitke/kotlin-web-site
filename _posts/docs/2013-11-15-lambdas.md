## High-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that takes functions as parameters, or returns a function. A good example of such a function is lock() that takes a lock object and a function, acquires the lock, runs the functions and releases the lock:

{% highlight kotlin %}
fun lock<T>(lock : Lock, body : () -> T) : T {
  lock.lock()
  try {
    return body()
  }
  finally {
    lock.unlock();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
