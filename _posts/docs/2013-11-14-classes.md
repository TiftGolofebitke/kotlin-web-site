## Classes

Classes are first-class citizens in Kotlin and are declared using the keyword *class*{: .keyword }

{% highlight kotlin %}
class Invoice {

}
{% endhighlight %}

Class bodies are optional. In Kotlin if a class has no body, it can omit the curly braces


{% highlight kotlin %}
class Invoice
{% endhighlight %}


### Constructors

Classes in Kotlin can only have a single constructor, which is declared in the header and any initialization code should be enclosed in an anonymous initializer

{% highlight kotlin %}
class Customer(name: String) {

    {
        logger.info("Customer initialized with value ${name}")
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
```

If the initialization is merely assigning values to class properties, this can be done without having to use an anonymous initializer

{% highlight kotlin %}
class Customer(name: String) {
    val customerName = name
}
{% endhighlight %}

In fact, for declaring properties and initializing them from the constructor, Kotlin has a more concise syntax

{% highlight kotlin %}
class Customer(val customerName: String) {

}
{% endhighlight %}

which is equivalent to the previous code. Much the same way as when declaring properties, those explicitly
declared in the constructor can be mutable (*var*{: keyword }) or immutable (*val*{: keyword }).

### Creating instances of classes

To create an instance of a class, we call the constructor as if it were a regular function

{% highlight kotlin %}
val = Invoice()

val = Customer("Joe Smith")
{% endhighlight %}

Note that Kotlin does not have a *new*{: .keyword }


### Class Members

Classes can contain

* [Functions]({% post_url docs/2013-11-13-functions %})
* [Properties]({% post_url docs/2013-11-15-properties %})
* [Nested and Inner Classes]({% post_url docs/2013-11-15-nested-classes %})
* [Object Declarations]({% post_url docs/2013-11-15-object-declarations %})
