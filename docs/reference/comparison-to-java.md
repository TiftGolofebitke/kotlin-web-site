# Comparison to Java

## Some Java issues addressed in Kotlin

Kotlin fixes a series of issues that Java suffers from

* Null references are controlled by the type system.
* Full type information is retained at runtime
* No raw types
* Arrays in Kotlin are invariant
* Kotlin has high-order functions, a.k.a. closures
* Use-site variance without wildcards
* Kotlin does not have checked exceptions

## What Java has that Kotlin does not

* Checked exceptions
* Primitive types that are not objects
* Static members
* Non-private fields
* Type erasure
* Wildcard-types

## What Kotlin has that Java does not

* Function literals + Inline functions = performant custom control structures
* Null-safety
* Smart casts
* String templates
* Properties
* Primary constructors
* Mixins and First-class delegation
* Extension functions
* Type inference for variable and property types
* Singletons
* Declaration-site variance & Type projections
* Modules
* Range expressions
* Pattern matching
* Generic types retained at runtime
* Operator overloading
* Class objects
