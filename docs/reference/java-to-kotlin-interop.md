# Calling Kotlin from Java

Kotlin code can be called from Java easily.

## Properties

Property getters are turned into *get*-methods, and setters â€“ into *set*-methods.

## Package-Level Functions

All the functions and properties declared in a file `example.kt` inside a package `org.foo.bar` are put into a Java
class named `org.foo.bar.ExampleKt`.

``` kotlin
// example.kt
package demo

class Foo

fun bar() {
}

```

``` java
// Java
new demo.Foo();
demo.ExampleKt.bar();
```

The name of the generated Java class can be changed using the `@JvmName` annotation:

``` kotlin
@file:JvmName("DemoUtils")

package demo

class Foo

fun bar() {
}

```

``` java
// Java
new demo.Foo();
demo.DemoUtils.bar();
```

Having multiple files which have the same generated Java class name (the same package and the same name or the same
@JvmName annotation) is normally an error. However, the compiler has the ability to generate a single Java facade
class which has the specified name and contains all the declarations from all the files which have that name.
To enable the generation of such a facade, use the @JvmMultifileClass annotation in all of the files.

``` kotlin
// oldutils.kt
@file:JvmName("Utils")
@file:JvmMultifileClass

package demo

fun foo() {
}
```

``` kotlin
// newutils.kt
@file:JvmName("Utils")
@file:JvmMultifileClass

package demo

fun bar() {
}
```

``` java
// Java
demo.Utils.foo();
demo.Utils.bar();
```

## Fields

If you need to expose a Kotlin property as a field in Java, you need to annotate it with the `@JvmField` annotation.
The field will have the same visibility as the underlying property. You can annotate a property with `@JvmField`
if it has a backing field, is not private, does not have `open`, `override` or `const` modifiers, and is not a delegated property.

``` kotlin
class C(id: String) {
    @JvmField val ID = id
}
```

``` java
// Java
class JavaClient {
    public String getID(C c) {
        return c.ID;
    }
}
```

## Static Methods and Fields

As mentioned above, Kotlin generates static methods for package-level functions. On top of that, it also generates static methods
for functions defined in named objects or companion objects of classes and annotated as `@JvmStatic`. For example:

``` kotlin
class C {
  companion object {
    @JvmStatic fun foo() {}
    fun bar() {}
  }
}
```

Now, `foo()` is static in Java, while `bar()` is not:

``` java
C.foo(); // works fine
C.bar(); // error: not a static method
```

Same for named objects:

``` kotlin
object Obj {
    @JvmStatic fun foo() {}
    fun bar() {}
}
```

In Java:

``` java
Obj.foo(); // works fine
Obj.bar(); // error
Obj.INSTANCE.bar(); // works, a call through the singleton instance
Obj.INSTANCE.foo(); // works too
```

Also, public properties defined in objects and companion objects, as well as top-level properties annotated with `const`,
are turned into static fields in Java:

``` kotlin
// file example.kt

object Obj {
  val CONST = 1
}

const val MAX = 239
```

In Java:

``` java
int c = Obj.CONST;
int d = ExampleKt.MAX;
```

## Handling signature clashes with @JvmName

Sometimes we have a named function in Kotlin, for which we need a different JVM name the byte code.
The most prominent example happens due to *type erasure*:

``` kotlin
fun List<String>.filterValid(): List<String>
fun List<Int>.filterValid(): List<Int>
```

These two functions can not be defined side-by-side, because their JVM signatures are the same: `filterValid(Ljava/util/List;)Ljava/util/List;`.
If we really want them to have the same name in Kotlin, we can annotate one (or both) of them with `@JvmName` and specify a different name as an argument:

``` kotlin
fun List<String>.filterValid(): List<String>

@JvmName("filterValidInt")
fun List<Int>.filterValid(): List<Int>
```

From Kotlin they will be accessible by the same name `filterValid`, but from Java it will be `filterValid` and `filterValidInt`.

The same trick applies when we need to have a property `x` alongside with a function `getX()`:

``` kotlin
val x: Int
  @JvmName("getX_prop")
  get() = 15

fun getX() = 10
```


## Overloads Generation

Normally, if you write a Kotlin method with default parameter values, it will be visible in Java only as a full
signature, with all parameters present. If you wish to expose multiple overloads to Java callers, you can use the
@JvmOverloads annotation.

``` kotlin
@JvmOverloads fun f(a: String, b: Int = 0, c: String = "abc") {
    ...
}
```

For every parameter with a default value, this will generate one additional overload, which has this parameter and
all parameters to the right of it in the parameter list removed. In this example, the following methods will be
generated:

``` java
// Java
void f(String a, int b, String c) { }
void f(String a, int b) { }
void f(String a) { }
```

The annotation also works for constructors, static methods etc. It can't be used on abstract methods, including methods
defined in interfaces.

Note that, as described in [Secondary Constructors](classes.html#secondary-constructors), if a class has default
values for all constructor parameters, a public no-argument constructor will be generated for it. This works even
if the @JvmOverloads annotation is not specified.


## Checked Exceptions

As we mentioned above, Kotlin does not have checked exceptions.
So, normally, the Java signatures of Kotlin functions do not declare exceptions thrown.
Thus if we have a function in Kotlin like this:

``` kotlin
// example.kt
package demo

fun foo() {
  throw IOException()
}
```

And we want to call it from Java and catch the exception:

``` java
// Java
try {
  demo.Example.foo();
}
catch (IOException e) { // error: foo() does not declare IOException in the throws list
  // ...
}
```

we get an error message from the Java compiler, because `foo()` does not declare `IOException`.
To work around this problem, use the `@Throws` annotation in Kotlin:

``` kotlin
@Throws(IOException::class)
fun foo() {
    throw IOException()
}
```

## Null-safety

When calling Kotlin functions from Java, nobody prevents us from passing *null*{: .keyword } as a non-null parameter.
That's why Kotlin generates runtime checks for all public functions that expect non-nulls.
This way we get a `NullPointerException` in the Java code immediately.
